This program was made for a narrow application task in which it was necessary to cut seeds from an X-ray into separate files - images. 
The main point of the entire task is to collect data for further training of the classifier, so that the code can not cut absolutely all the seeds, 
but only those that the X-ray operator managed to place inside the frame. Seeds falling on or outside the frame will not be counted.


An example of an x-ray will be attached. As already written, the program has a very narrow profile; it only works with specific images - x-rays. 
Due to the peculiarities of the physics of the process, the seeds in such photographs are white. 
If you have received an image of seeds, where after digital processing the seeds, on the contrary, are dark, 
then you must manually invert the values for the image on which the frame and contours of the seeds are searched.


By default, the path to the image and the path for saving images are specified manually. 
The extension for X-ray images is also .tif. X-ray images must be in this extension and located in the same folder as the program file. 
If they donâ€™t, you will have to change it manually in the code. Folders for saving chopped seeds are created automatically.


To chop seeds, you need to use a separate method for cutting - .chop(form), where form is the extension of the chopped files.
